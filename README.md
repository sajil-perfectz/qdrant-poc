# Qdrant Vector Embedding Storage & Querying

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to store and query vector embeddings using Qdrant DB. Qdrant provides a fully managed vector database optimized for scalable and fast similarity search across high-dimensional vectors.

## Features

- **Store Vector Embeddings**: Demonstrates how to store vector embeddings in Qdrant DB using a simple and efficient process.
- **Query Vector Embeddings**: Demonstrates how to query the database for nearest neighbors or similar vectors based on cosine similarity.
- **Qdrant Integration**: Step-by-step guide on integrating Qdrant with your machine learning workflows.
